🤖 **AI Resume Screening System**

An end-to-end NLP & Machine Learning project that automatically analyzes resumes and predicts the most relevant job role.
The application also extracts skills and years of experience from resumes and provides results through a Streamlit web app.

📌 Project Overview

Recruiters receive hundreds of resumes daily. Manually screening them is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project automates the resume screening process by:

Classifying resumes into job roles

Extracting technical skills

Extracting years of experience

Providing an interactive web interface for real-time predictions

🎯 Features

✔ Resume Classification (ML Model)
✔ Skills Extraction (NLP Keyword Matching)
✔ Experience Extraction (Regex Based)
✔ Supports multiple formats: PDF, DOCX, DOC
✔ Interactive Streamlit Web App
✔ End-to-end ML pipeline

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Dataset contains resumes categorized into:

React Developer

SQL Developer

Workday

Peoplesoft

2️⃣ Text Extraction

Resumes are parsed using:

File Type	Library
PDF	PyPDF2
DOCX	python-docx
DOC	LibreOffice conversion
3️⃣ Text Preprocessing

• Lowercasing
• Stopword removal
• Tokenization
• Lemmatization
• Special token replacement for numbers

4️⃣ Feature Engineering

Text converted to numerical vectors using:

TF-IDF Vectorization

Unigrams + Bigrams

Feature selection applied

5️⃣ Model Building

Five algorithms were compared:

Model	Result
Naive Bayes	100% Accuracy
Logistic Regression	100% Accuracy
Support Vector Machine (Final Model)	⭐ Best
Random Forest	100% Accuracy
KNN	Slightly lower
Final Model Selected:

Linear SVM with Hyperparameter Tuning

6️⃣ Model Validation

• Stratified Train-Test Split
• 10-Fold Cross Validation
• Repeated Cross Validation

Final Mean CV Accuracy ≈ 98%
